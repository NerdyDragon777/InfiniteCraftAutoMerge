# InfiniteCraftAutoMerge
Will choose two random elements and merge them together in Infinite Craft.
In your browser, make a bookmark on the upper bar of the screen. Copy and paste the contents of bookmarklet.txt into it. Whenever you boot up infinite craft, click the book mark. Credit to Snazzah for the button creation and random element spawning code.
